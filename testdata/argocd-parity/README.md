# Argo CD parity fixture

This fixture is a deterministic local GitOps repository for the manual Argo CD
parity smoke. The manifests under `repo/` are intentionally small and avoid
remote chart and remote Kustomize fetches.

Application and ApplicationSet specs use the canonical placeholder repository
URL:

`git://argocd-parity-git.argocd-parity.svc.cluster.local/repo.git`

The smoke harness maps that URL back to this local fixture repository with
`--repo-map` so drydock and Argo CD render the same source tree.

## OCI artifact fixture

`oci-artifact/` is the content directory for the one first-class OCI
Application, `parity-oci-config`:

- repoURL `oci://argocd-parity-registry.argocd-parity.svc.cluster.local:5443/parity/config`
- exact pinned tag `v1.0.0`, `path: .`, plain manifests only

The smoke harness pushes the directory contents with `oras push` from inside
the directory, producing exactly one
`application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip` content layer with the
manifests at the extraction root, then verifies that manifest shape before
Argo CD ever sees the artifact. drydock warms its `--oci-cache-dir` with one
non-offline build of the app before the offline per-app loop runs.

The content directory deliberately lives outside `repo/` so the artifact
content is never part of the git fixture Argo CD serves. An OCI
classification regression that fell back to path-exists resolution would
render the whole fixture repository instead of the artifact and flip the
comparison hard.

### Deliberately not covered by this fixture

- The `oci://` + `chart:` divergence shape: live Argo CD v3.4.5 rejects that
  combination, and the harness has no expected-to-fail-on-Argo notion
  (capture hard-fails on empty output). That shape stays pinned by fleet and
  unit tests only.
- The helm-content-inside-first-class-artifact shape (no `chart:` field, a
  `Chart.yaml` inside the artifact): hermetically pinned by unit tests, not
  live-pinned. This plain-manifests fixture does not cover it. It is a
  distinct shape from the `oci://` + `chart:` divergence above; do not
  conflate the two.
- Semver tag constraints (a tag-list moving part), registry authentication
  (an htpasswd surface for a hermetically-pinned path), and multi-registry
  setups.

### Local runs

The registry bridge requires an `/etc/hosts` entry for
`argocd-parity-registry.argocd-parity.svc.cluster.local`. The smoke script
appends it with `sudo` and removes its own marked line on exit; a
pre-existing entry for that hostname skips `sudo` entirely. On macOS the
bridge uses local port 5443 (AirPlay owns 5000) and certificate generation
uses the LibreSSL-compatible config-file `subjectAltName` form.
